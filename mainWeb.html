        <h1>How To make a paper crane</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="content">
        <div class="step-1">
            <h2>Step 1: Get a square piece of paper</h2>
            <p>Make sure the paper is square. You can use origami paper or cut a regular piece of paper into a square shape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-2">
            <h2>Step 2: X Fold</h2>
            <p>Fold the paper in half diagonally both ways to create an X fold.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-3">
            <h2>Step 3: + Fold</h2>
            <p>Open it up and fold the paper in half horizontally and vertically to create a + fold.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-4">
            <h2>Step 4: Squash it down </h2>
            <p>Using the creases you just made, fold the paper into a square base by bringing the corners together and flattening it down.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-5">
            <h2>Step 5: Shape it into a kite</h2>
            <p>Fold the flaps of the square base into the center line to create kite shapes on both sides.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-6">
            <h2>Step 6: Top Flap crease</h2>
            <p>Fold the top layer of the kite shape down to create a triangle.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-7">
            <h2>Step 7: Repeat the process</h2>
            <p>Repeat steps 5 and 6 on the other side of the paper to create a symmetrical kite shape.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-8">
            <h2>Step 8: Frog mouth to Diamond</h2>
            <p>Now with the creases made in step 5, open it up to the point of the crease made in 6 and fold the flaps in to the middle. Repeat on the other side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-10">
            <h2>Step 10: Skinny kite fold</h2>
            <p>With the diamond shape, Create a skinny kite fold by folding the outside corners in the flap into the middle. Repeat on the other side.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-11">
            <h2>Step 11: Wolf head fold</h2>
            <p>With the skinny kite shape, reverse the flaps to make it look like a wolf head with long nose and ears.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-12">
            <h2>Step 12: Crown fold</h2>
            <p>Fold the nose flap up to the same height of the ears. Repeat on both sides.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-13">
            <h2>Step 13: Book fold</h2>
            <p>Similar to step 11, inverse the folds </p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-14">
            <h2>Step 14: Tail + Head fold</h2>
            <p> Pull the flaps that were folded up to match parallel to the base and one end crease and fold down a quarter down to create the head</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-15">
            <h2>Step 15: Wing fold</h2>
            <p>Fold down the remaining flaps to create the wings of the crane.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-16">
            <h2>Step 16: Puff it up</h2>
            <p>Gently pull from the base of the crane's (opposite legs) to puff it up. Now you have a completed paper crane!</p>
